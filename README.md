# Exercises-C-Language

Very old exercises I had to come up with for an exam during my bachelor degree.

Nothing super advanced and given the long time, the quality may be not the best.

For that exam I was required to compile from command prompt using gcc. I'm not going to go into the
details of how to install gcc, set it up, and how to compile code. The good thing is that the number of
files is very minimal.

I've also included the files to test these programs on and some results.
